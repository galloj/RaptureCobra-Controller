# Controlling of Rapture Cobra mouse

The python script in this repository can be used for controlling Rapture Cobra mouse - set its colors, polling rate, DPI.

You have to install `libusb`/`libusb_package` as dependency. Also if you are running on Windows then you will need to use [Zading](https://zadig.akeo.ie/), `Options -> List all devices`, `2.4G Wireless Mouse (Interface 2)` and `Replace driver`. Please note that this will make you unable to use the mouse with the orignal software unless you remove the WinUSB driver from the device.
